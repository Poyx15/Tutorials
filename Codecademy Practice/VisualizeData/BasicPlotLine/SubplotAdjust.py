# We can customize the spacing between our subplots to make sure that the figure we create is visible and easy to understand. To do this, we use the plt.subplots_adjust() command. .subplots_adjust() has some keyword arguments that can move your plots within the figure:
#
# left — the left-side margin, with a default of 0.125. You can increase this number to make room for a y-axis label
# right — the right-side margin, with a default of 0.9. You can increase this to make more room for the figure, or decrease it to make room for a legend
# bottom — the bottom margin, with a default of 0.1. You can increase this to make room for tick mark labels or an x-axis label
# top — the top margin, with a default of 0.9
# wspace — the horizontal space between adjacent subplots, with a default of 0.2
# hspace — the vertical space between adjacent subplots, with a default of 0.2
